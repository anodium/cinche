Top-down racer I'm making to learn Haxe and HaxeFlixel

Originally intended as my entry to #LowRezJam2016


## Description

Play with friends together to try to box each others' dits in and make them collide against your laser barrier (or, maybe theirs, if you're clever enough?)


## Features

* TODO


## Usage

### Launching the app

[`Kivy`](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) is compatible with Python 2 as well as Python 3:

```bash
cd cinche
python main.py
```


### Running the testsuite

Run its testsuite either with Python3:

```bash
cd cinche
python -m unittest discover
```

Or with [`nose`](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/):

```bash
cd cinche
nosetests
```

Or with [`py.test`](http://pytest.org/latest/):

```bash
cd cinche
py.test
```


### Deploying to Android

You can easily run the app on Android by using the [`Kivy Launcher`](http://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-android.html#packaging-your-application-for-the-kivy-launcher).
